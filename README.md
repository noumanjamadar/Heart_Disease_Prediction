## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction Model** built using **Machine Learning** and deployed with **Streamlit** for a smooth and interactive user experience.  

The model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical features such as **blood pressure, cholesterol, age, BMI, and sugar levels**, helping in **early diagnosis and preventive care**.  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
- Source: **Cleveland dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).  
- Includes clinical attributes such as:  
  - Age, Sex  
  - Resting Blood Pressure  
  - Cholesterol levels  
  - Fasting Blood Sugar  
  - ECG results  
  - Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
  - Exercise Induced Angina  
  - Oldpeak, Slope, Thalassemia, etc.  

---

## 🛠 Project Workflow  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔍  
   - Identified correlations between features.  
   - Visualized patterns in patients with and without heart disease.  

2. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Scaled numerical features.  

3. **Model Training** 🤖  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  

4. **Evaluation Metrics** 📊  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - ROC-AUC  

5. **Deployment** 🌐  
   - Built an interactive **Streamlit App** for real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Key Learnings  
- Importance of **EDA** in understanding feature distribution and spotting outliers.  
- **Selection of Evaluation Metrics** (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) is critical in healthcare, where false negatives can be dangerous.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** improves model generalization and reduces overfitting.  
- End-to-end pipeline: from raw data → model → **deployment** on Streamlit.  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved **89% Accuracy** ✅  
- ROC-AUC Score: **0.92** 🏆  
- Reliable predictions with balanced **Precision & Recall**
